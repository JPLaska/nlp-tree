						MonaSearch readme
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading MonaSearch, querying tree banks with Mona.

Invoke the jar file as follows:

  java -Djava.library.path=←path-to-library→ -jar MonaSearch.jar

On Linux, the library is called ‘libmona.so’, on Windows ‘mona.dll’ and on Mac
‘libmona.jnilib’.
Make sure the library and the java you are running are compiled for the same
architecture (especially, a 32-bit Java will complain about a 64-bit library,
and converse).

The file test50.export contains a sample of 50 trees from the TüBa-D/Z corpus.
Note that MonaSearch expects corpora to be in UTF-8 encoding.  Nothing will go
wrong if they aren’t, but your words won’t look like you expect them, and it
will be difficult looking for them.

The file example-formulas.txt contains some sample formulas in the fsq-style
syntax.  You can use them as inspiration on how to type in formulas by hand.
In example-formulas.form, on the other hand, you can find some formulas that
were saved from the UI and which you can load with the “Open…” command.  Note
that the file ending chosen is arbitrary, you can choose another one if you
want.

The source code is available via Subversion, see the website:
